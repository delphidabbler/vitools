# Version Information Tools

Version Information Tools (or verinfo-tools) was an old project on GoogleCode that provided a home for three distinct sub-projects, all of which had something to do with the creation or reading of version information stored in Windows executables.

When Google announced the closure of GoogleCode the project was split into its three component parts and a GitHub project was created for each one.

They are:

* [delphidabbler/vied](https://github.com/delphidabbler/vied) - Version Information Editor for Windows that enables version information to be included in a program to be edited via a GUI.
* [delphidabbler/vispy](https://github.com/delphidabbler/vispy) - Version Information Spy for Windows that displays all version information stored in a Windows program's resources.
* [delphidabbler/vilib](https://github.com/delphidabbler/vilib) - Version Information Library for Windows that is a DLL that provides services to read/write version information in a Windows binary resource file.

# Downloads

Binary releases of these projects can be downloaded from their respective GitHub project "releases" tabs.
